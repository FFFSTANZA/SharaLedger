            <h1>Versoll Books Documentation</h1>
            <p>Welcome to the Versoll Books documentation. This guide will help you understand what accounting is, what accounting software does, and why Versoll Books is the right choice for your business.</p>

            <h2>What is Accounting?</h2>
            <p>Accounting is the process of recording, organizing, and analyzing financial transactions of a business. It helps businesses understand:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>How much money they are earning</li>
                <li>How much they are spending</li>
                <li>Whether they are making a profit or loss</li>
                <li>Their financial position at any given time</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Without accounting, a business cannot make informed financial decisions. Proper accounting ensures that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>All transactions are recorded systematically</li>
                <li>Financial reports can be generated accurately</li>
                <li>Tax obligations can be met on time</li>
                <li>The business remains compliant with legal requirements</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What is an Accounting Software?</h2>
            <p>An accounting software is a digital tool that helps businesses manage their finances efficiently. Instead of maintaining manual books or spreadsheets, accounting software provides several advantages:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Automatically records transactions</li>
                <li>Reduces human errors</li>
                <li>Saves time</li>
                <li>Generates reports instantly</li>
                <li>Keeps financial data organized and secure</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Modern accounting software handles complex tasks like:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Creating invoices and bills</li>
                <li>Tracking payments and receipts</li>
                <li>Managing inventory</li>
                <li>Calculating taxes automatically</li>
                <li>Generating financial statements</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>Why Use Software Instead of Spreadsheets?</h4>
                <p>While spreadsheets can work for very small businesses, they lack automation, are prone to errors, and become difficult to manage as the business grows. Accounting software is designed specifically for financial management and provides structure, accuracy, and efficiency.</p>
